## [Unreleased]

- Removed E621 engine. (iqdb.harry.lu shut down)
- Added E621 handler to saucenao.
- Changed saucenao engine internally to allow for adding handlers easier.
- Changed response data for engines to allow returning more than one valid source.

## [2.3.1] - 2019-10-20

- Recover from organization takedown/repo removal.
- Added makefile for testing/building simplification
- Added aiohttp to repository dependencies, it went missing after removing aiohttp_requests
- Added attribute to config to skip IQDB creation.
- Added dedicated exception type to handle engines that are unavailable due to external reasons.

## [2.3.0] - 2019-10-06

- Changed logging so it goes to the correct logger.
- Removed ratelimiting for SauceNao. It just raises an exception instead, no matter what.
  - Sleeping causes underflows. Unless there's a way to properly handle this, there's no way around it.
- Changed asyncio tasking
  - Somewhere around a 30% speed gain comparatively to how it was before.
- Fixed IQDB tag names.

## [2.2.0] - 2019-09-12

- Added logging to core.
- Removed dependency on aiohttp_requests library
  - Well, sorta. It localizes the library to an internal folder instead.
  - This is to prevent aiohttp from being version pinned.
- Fixed UnboundLocalError in E621.
- Fixed Core bug where a source would be split up into individual characters (and then added to a set).

## [2.1.4] - 2019-09-12

- Fixed e621 premature ratelimit call

## [2.1.3] - 2019-09-12

- Fixed ratelimit underflow bug on low values.

## [2.1.2] - 2019-09-12

- Added source code references to documentation.
- Fixed the callback, it now returns ImageResult rather than ReverseResult.
- Fixed premature reference assignment in Paheal engine (not sure how this slipped past testing).

## [2.1.1] - 2019-09-11

- Fixed crucial endless loop bug due to incorrect ratelimit checking.
- Fixed formatting error in documentation.

## [2.1.0] - 2019-09-11 [YANKED]

- Changed search methods to be more async (request calls weren't run_in_executor).
- Changed SauceNao ratelimit accounting to function better.

## [2.0.0] - 2019-09-10

- Changed callback to be more comprehensive.
- Changed SauceNao to account for ratelimits properly.
- Changed E621 to accunt for ratelimits properly.
- Changed responses to namedtuples. Namedtuples can be better documented and permit dotted access.
  - Two new classes: ImageResult and ReverseResult.
  - Classes share attributes but differ in types on said attributes.
- Changed search_image in API classes:
  - Removed deprecated search_image
  - Renamed search_image_source to search_image.
  - As a result of this, search_image_source is effectively removed.
- Changed reverse_search in core class:
  - Removed deprecated reverse_search
  - Renamed search_image_source to reverse_search
  - As a result of this, search_image_source is effectively removed.
- Rename all mentions of booru to engine.
  - Renamed NotAValidBooruException to NotAValidEngineException
- Added new helper method to base API to handle ratelimits.
- Added VS Code Build and test tasks.
- Added new package variable: `__version__` and `version_info` to track versioning.
- Added sample `test.sh` for testing purposes.
- Fixed reverse_search to skip saucenao if on long ratelimit in reverse_search

- Expanded base engine class to also permit searching for sources.
- Changed base engine class to have default behavior for searching for sources.
- Added SauceNao parser.
- Added source searching to Danbooru.
- Added source searching to E621.
